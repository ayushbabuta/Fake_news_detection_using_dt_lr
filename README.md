Fake News Detection Project
This project is designed to detect whether a given news article is real or fake using machine learning algorithms. It is part of my BCA final-year project and demonstrates the practical application of both linear and non-linear classification techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Features
Classifies news as fake or real

Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction from text

Implements dimensionality reduction using PCA (work in progress)

Compares performance of linear and non-linear models

Built with Python and trained on real-world news datasets

Algorithms Used
Linear Model
Logistic Regression: A popular linear classifier that models the probability of the input belonging to a particular class.

Non-Linear Model
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based non-linear model that splits data based on feature conditions and handles complex decision boundaries.

Technologies
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Project Summary
Models: Logistic Regression (Linear), Decision Tree (Non-linear)

Developed a machine learning-based system to classify news articles as fake or real using text classification techniques.

Applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction from news text.

Implemented and compared linear (Logistic Regression) and non-linear (Decision Tree) models to evaluate classification accuracy.

Currently Working On
Integrating web scraping to fetch real-time fake news data

Enhancing dimensionality reduction using PCA for optimal feature selection

Preparing for deployment as a web application using Flask and AWS EC2
