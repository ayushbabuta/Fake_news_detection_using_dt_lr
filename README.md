📰 Fake News Detection Project

This project is designed to detect whether a given news article is real or fake using machine learning algorithms. It is part of my BCA final-year project and demonstrates the practical application of both linear and non-linear classification techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

📌 Features

Classifies news as fake or real

Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction from text

Compares performance of linear and non-linear models

Built with Python, trained on real-world news datasets

🧠 Algorithms Used
✅ Linear Model:

Logistic Regression: A popular linear classifier that models the probability of the input belonging to a particular class.

✅ Non-Linear Model:

Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based non-linear model that splits data based on feature conditions and handles complex decision boundaries.
